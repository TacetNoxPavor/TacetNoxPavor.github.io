#### A Twitch.tv bot built using a modified version of the PircBotX framework

This bot is the first one that I worked on for the Twitch.tv streamer Tritemare.

It was created as a replacement/update to a bot that had been initially created by a previous
member of the chat who was going to be stepping down and needed to be maintained, however I was
more comfortable with Java as opposed to Python.

Building this bot resulted in my promotion to a Moderator for the stream as it showed I was much more involved
than an average viewer in maintaining a positive stream chat experience, which I still hold to this day.
