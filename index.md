This is a place for all information to be found regarding any and all projects that I may be currently working on, given that I update this page as well! Also, some personal information about me and the way I operate will also be listed here.

### About Me

Hi there!
For my online presence I use the handle **Tacet Nox**, however my real world name is Jesse McDermott.

I went to school at Wilkes University in Pennsylvania, majoring in Computer Information Systems.
I graduated back in 2017, and am currently looking for a job related to my field.
